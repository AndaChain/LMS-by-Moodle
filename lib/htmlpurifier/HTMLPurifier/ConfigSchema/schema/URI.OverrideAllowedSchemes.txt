URI.OverrideAllowedSchemes
TYPE: bool
DEFAULT: true
--DESCRIPTION--
If this is set to true (which it is by default), you can override
%URI.AllowedSchemes by simply registering a HTMLPurifier_URIScheme to the
registry.  If false, you will also have to update that directive in order
to add more schemes.
